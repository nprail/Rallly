Rallly is a free collaborative scheduling service that helps you and your friends vote on a date to host an event. The application has been developed with the [MEAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN) stack of technologies.


## Getting Started Quickly with Docker
*This assumes that you have Docker installed*

To get started quickly and easily, simply run the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lukevella/Rallly.git
cd Rallly
```
Copy the sample `.env` file then open it and set the variables. 
```bash
cp sample.env .env
```
Now run the server!
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now that was simple!

## Manual Setup [Detailed Production Docs](docs/production/README.md)
### Requirements

To run Rallly you will need:

* MongoDB
* Node.js + npm
* Bower (Not Necessary)

### Setup

Clone the repository on your machine and set the current directory to the root of the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lukevella/Rallly.git
cd Rallly
```
Run the install script. This will install the node and bower dependencies and create a configuration file.

```bash
npm run installation
```

#### Manual Configuration
*Only do this if you did not run `npm run installation`*

Run the config script. 
```bash
npm run installation -- -p
```
Open up `config.json` and fill in the parameters.

```javascript
{
    "port": 3000,
    "siteUrl": "http://localhost:3000", // Used for creating an absolute URL
    "fromName": "Rallly", // Email from name
    "fromEmail": "no-reploy@rallly.co", // Email from address
    "dbName": "rallly", // MongoDB database name
    "dbAddress": "localhost", // MongoDB address not including port. 
    "dbUser": "", // MongoDB user name - leave blank if MongoDB auth is disabled
    "dbPwd": "", // MongoDB user password - leave blank if MongoDB auth is disabled
    "smtpUser": "", // SMTP user name
    "smtpPwd": "", // SMTP user password
    "smtpHost": "", // SMTP host
    "smtpPort": 587 // SMTP port
}
```

#### Running
To start the node server simply run `npm start`.

### Development [Detailed Docs](docs/development/README.md)
If you're going to be developing, run the `watch` task with gulp. Gulp is used to build the CSS (with SASS), JS and templates.

```bash
gulp watch
npm start
```
